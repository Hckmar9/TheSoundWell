## 🪩 Overview

I wanted to use something free of adds and without needing to add my
information. There are a lot of great apps, we should support them, BUT, I
wanted to create mine, this is for educational purposes. I'm, planning to add
more features soon. Sounds credits to [ZapSplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/)
